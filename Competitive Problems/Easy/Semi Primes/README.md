### Chef and Semi-Primes

Chef likes prime numbers. However, there is one thing he loves even more. Of course, it's semi-primes! A semi-prime number is an integer which can be expressed as a product of two distinct primes. For example, 15=3⋅5 is a semi-prime number, but 1, 9=3⋅3 and 5 are not.

Chef is wondering how to check if an integer can be expressed as a sum of two (not necessarily distinct) semi-primes. Help Chef with this tough task!

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer `T` denoting the number of test cases. The description of `T` test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer `N`.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to express `N` as a sum of two semi-primes or "NO" otherwise.

Constraints
* 1≤T≤200
