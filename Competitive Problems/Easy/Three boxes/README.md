# Three Boxes

Chef has 3 boxes of sizes A, B, and C respectively. He puts the boxes in bags of size `D` (`A`≤`B`≤`C`≤`D`). Find the minimum number of bags Chef needs so that he can put each box in a bag. A bag can contain more than one box if the sum of sizes of boxes in the bag does not exceed the size of the bag.

## Input Format
* The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
* Each test case contains four integers `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` on a single line denoting the sizes of the boxes and bags.

## Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the minimum number of bags Chef needs.

## Constraints
* 1≤`T`≤100
* 1≤`A`≤`B`≤`C`≤`D`≤100

## Subtasks
* Subtask 1 (100 points): Original constraints
